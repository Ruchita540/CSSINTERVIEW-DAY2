           <!-- Explain CSS box model -->
           <!-- The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.  -->

           Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
           Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
           Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent. -->

           <!-- display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space. -->
